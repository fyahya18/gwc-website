<h1> Introduction</h1>
<p><font color="white">Hi! I'm 17 years old, and I'll be 18 in less than 3 months. I'll be entering my senior year in the fall, and I live in Lawrenceville, Georgia. I love playing soccer and of course I love sleeping! Next after that, I love to eat, usually very unhealthy food...I'm planning on going to college and majoring in pyschology or going down the technology route. I would love to go to Georgia Tech or Emory, but I haven't decided yet.</font></p>

<h4> Likes: </h4>
<p><font color="white"> I love Spaghetti Junction! It's easily my favorite place, at least in Georgia. I think the chaotic synchrony soothes me. I also love anything orange flavored or orange scented because oranges are definitely my favorite fruit.

<button onclick="myFunction()">Click me!</button>

<script>
function myFunction() {
  alert("Fun fact: I really want to go to the top of spaghetti junction, but no one wants to take me there:(");
}
</script>

<h4> Dislikes: </h4>
<p><font color="white"> I hate most vegetables but especially Broccoli. It smells terrible and tastes even worse. I was always forced to eat it when I was younger, so it's definitely my least favorite now.
